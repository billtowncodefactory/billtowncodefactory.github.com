# Billtown Code Factory

A place for coders in the Williamsport, PA area to share ideas.

## Contributing

We're using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and 
[Github pages](http://help.github.com/pages/) to host the site.

To run the site locally, you'll need to install a copy of ruby and the jekyll
gem. Then clone this repository somewhere on your system and run:

```bash
jekyll --server --auto
```

Finally point your browser to localhost:4000! Submit pull requests on Github,
and if one is accepted, you'll get full commit access.

If you have any trouble contributing, jump on the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/billtowncodefactory)
and we'll be happy to help you along!

Thanks for contributing!
