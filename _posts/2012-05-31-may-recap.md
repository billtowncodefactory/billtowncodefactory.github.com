title: May Recap (First full month!)
---

Well, we've completed our first full month of the Billtown Code Factory, and
there's been a lot of activity - much more than I expected, in fact.  Thanks to
everyone who joined.  Let's welcome any newcomers!

This month we talked about:

 - [Project management and Scrum](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/billtowncodefactory/rgBIhWJZrkw/discussion)
 - [Getting started with Git](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/billtowncodefactory/Tm9BLAXPNp0/discussion)

Lyle also reposted a job opportunity at YouVersion, which sounds incredible.

Finally, we started a screencast series about CoffeeScript, in which we build
a working implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Looking ahead, there's lots
we can clean up with this code, and we can even start to explore OOP ideas.
