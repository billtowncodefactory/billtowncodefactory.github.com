tl;dr - Join the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/billtowncodefactory)
to get posts and announcements. Feel free to share interesting links or ask
questions.

## What is BCF?

Billtown Code Factory is a way for us to meet each other. Yeah, it's possible
to learn to program on your own. But, it's faster, easier, and more fun to do
it with others who are like you. I personally get jealous of the awesome meetups
in other cities like [Pittsburgh](http://pghrb.heroku.com/) and
[Baltimore](http://www.meetup.com/baltimore-dc-javascript-users/).

It's time for Williamsport to have it's own programming group.

## Plans

We've launched a mailing list that anyone can join. Join to share what you're
learning, see what others are learning, and ask questions. In the future we
also want to do meetups to talk to each other face to face. But, before we
plan anything like that, we want to get to know the people in this city.
