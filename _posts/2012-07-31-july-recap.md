title: July Recap

Our first quiet month on the mailing list, but don't expect that to keep up!
There's a lot in store, and with college kids coming back, we should be
planning our first meetup sooner rather than later.

Here's what we talked about this month:
 - [We had a long conversation about redesigning email](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/billtowncodefactory/iVgBIo7nocc)
 - [We found inspiration from a design firm called Nelson Cash](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/billtowncodefactory/IQU5ag7lgss)
